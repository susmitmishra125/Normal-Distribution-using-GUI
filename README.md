# Normal(Gaussian) Distribution
This project is an effort to create application that can calculate the probability of a Gaussian or normal distribution.

In probability theory, a normal (or **Gaussian** or **Gauss** or **Laplace–Gauss**) distribution is a type of continuous probability distribution for a real-valued random variable. The general form of its probability density function is ![](images/expression.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

The parameter &mu; is the mean or expectation of the distribution, while the parameter σ is its standard deviation. The variance of the distribution is &sigma;<sup>2</sup>. A random variable with a Gaussian distribution is said to be **normally distributed**.

## Standard Normal Distribution
The simplest case of a normal distribution is known as the standard normal distribution. This is a special case when &mu; = 0 and &sigma; = 1, and it is described by this probability density function .
